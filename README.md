<h1>Covid Patients Tracking System</h1>
A C# REST Api based system that allows different CRUD functions

<h2>Functionality</h2>
This system interacts with a remote MongoDB database.</br>
It allows patient creation, deletion and update.</br>
A nurse can use the different CRUD Endpoints to update the database with new patients that need to be tracked, </br>
add visit routes for infected patients, log encounters that each infected patient had with different people, </br>
make interviews with potential patients that each patient has encountered, get information about those encounters</br>
and get different statistics about healed, infected and isolated people in our system.</br>

<h2>Structure</h2>
The solution contains 2 projects:</br>
The first is 'covidtracking' - the project containing the system, implemented as a REST API service with different CRUD endpoints.</br>
The second is 'covidtracking.UnitTests' - the test project, containing different unit tests implemented with xUnit that cover the functionality of the system.</br>
The database used in this project is MongoDB and the connection string is hardcoded to ease the usage and testing.</br>

<h2>Architecture:</h2>
The 'covidtracking' is written as a REST API project.</br>
The project was implemented following the SOLID principles to allow the desired benefits.</br>
It contains divided into layers, kept in several folders, each contains the files used in that particular layer:</br>

<b>Controllers:</b></br>
The controllers are the layer that handles the different Http requests the API uses.</br>
Each controller handles the appropriate requests related to that area of the project/data:</br>
For example:</br>
LabTestController handles requests related to lab tests creation,</br>
StatisticsController handles statistics fetching from the database etc.</br>
Each controller communicates with the appropriate databases/collections needed for its operations.</br>

<b>Database:</b></br>
The database layer contains the different database models, each in its own internal folder for order and convenience.</br>
While we used MongoDB as our database in this project, any other DB (SQL SERVER...) can be used by implementing each model's</br>
interface contract. By using the Interfaces we enable our system to be more generic and responsive.</br>
The current concrete (MongoDB) models are injected using Dependency Injection in the Program.cs file.</br>
Each controller may use different DB models but each model only communicates with its single database/collection.</br>
<b>The models contain all the logic our system uses.</b>

<b>Dtos:</b></br>
We used Dtos (Data transfer objects) to handle Object creation and data transfer in a safe and agreed manner.</br>
Each area has its own Dtos and they are used across the project to create links and provide correct connections.</br>

<b>Entities:</b></br>
The entities represent each Entity's formal implementation.</br>
The Mongo database knows and stores those entities (while the internal data mostly uses Dtos).</br>

<b>Settings:</b></br>
The Settings folder contains the MongoDB settings (connection string).</br>

<b>Utilities:</b></br>
The Utilities folder contains different adapters and extensions used across the project.</br>

<h2>Testing</h2>
The project contains internal methods and statements to verify correctness of flow and protection in different edge points.</br>
We used conditional statements and REGEX to verify correctness.</br>
<b>Unit Testing</b></br>
the 'covidtracking.UnitTests' project contains the unit tests for our 'covidtracking' project.</br>
The unit tests, implemented using xUnit cover different endpoints and edge points our system has.</br>
The tests include ActionResult type Assertion, returned value comparison and it has passing/failing expected tests.</br>

<h1>Build and Workflow</h1>
<h2>Build and run</h2>
There are 2 ways to run this project:
The first option, run the project locally you just need to clone the repository and perform a regular run using VSCode/Visual Studio. The program will run on localhost, Port 7122 (https).</br>
To run the project, you just need to clone the repository and perform a regular run using VSCode/Visual Studio.</br>
The project supports Swagger UI or can be accessed using Postman.</br>
Use "https://localhost:7122/swagger/index.html" for Swagger or just "https://localhost:7122/" for Postman.</br>
We created a Postman workspace containing the different Endpoints the system has at:</br>
https://www.postman.com/lunar-firefly-552571/workspace/covidtracking</br>
The second option in running using docker:</br>
Start any terminal session (cmd, PowerShell, on VsCode, etc..) and write:</br>
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:80 nivrave/covidtrackingfinal:latest</br>
After downloading the image, the project will run on a docker container.</br>
Pay attention that in this method the Protocol will be http (not https) and the Port is 8080 (not 7122).</br>
Use the following address on any communication platform to access the Api:</br>
http://localhost:8080</br>


<h2>CI/CD</h2>
This GitHub repository has an automatic CI/CD workflow.</br>
It is implemented using 'GitHub Actions' and is activated on each push/pull request to the 'main' branch.</br>
The workflow builds the project and commits 30 unit tests.</br>
If those stages are passed - the Docker image is built (updated) and deployed to the docker</br>
hub repository at nivrave/covidtrackingfinal</br>
